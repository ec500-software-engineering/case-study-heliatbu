# Case Study: React Native

## Technology and Platform used for development
### Language and Basic Ideas
React Native only use JavaScript (JSX) to build mobile apps. As React, we can compose moblie UI using self-defined components.
<br /> But unlike web development in ReactJS, react native will not generate virtual DOM. It will only use the same fundamental UI building blocks as regular iOS and Android apps. Instead of using Swift, Kotlin or Java, we are putting those building blocks together using JavaScript and React.
